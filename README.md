This mod adds three powerful and exciting mounts to Necesse, allowing you to explore the world in new and exciting ways:

**Bat Mount:**
* Gain night vision during the nighttime for enhanced visibility.

**Spider Mount:**
* Gain +10 additional spider summons when using your Spider Staff.
* *These extra summons disappear when you dismount or use another summon item.*

**Crocodile Mount:**
* Gain more speed on water than in land.

**Polar Bear Mount:**
* Gives you +50 max health.

**How to Obtain Your Mounts:**

* Defeat the Evil Protector for a chance to get the Bat Mount.
* Defeat the Spider Queen for a chance to get the Spider Mount.
* Defeat the Swamp Guardian for a chance to get the Crocodile Mount.
* Defeat the Cryo Queen for a chance to get the Polar Bear Mount.

After defeating these bosses once, your friendly **traveling merchant** will have these mounts for sale.

***This mod is a remake of the original ["Mount Pack"](https://github.com/creativemindpie/mountpack) mod, which has been fixed, updated and improved for compatibility with the latest version of Necesse.***
