**Spider Mount:**
* Gain +10 additional spider summons when using your Spider Staff.
* *These extra summons disappear when you dismount or use another summon item.*

**Crocodile Mount:**
* Gain more speed on water than in land.

**Polar Bear Mount:**
* Gives you +50 max health.

**How to Obtain Your Mounts:**
